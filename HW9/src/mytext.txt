Java requires that each variable be initialized.
Java requires that each method declares a return type—the method should always return a value, except if its return type is void.
Java comes with a large set of classes and methods, the Java API that can be used without having to develop as much code "from scratch".
Unlike C, Java primitive types, such as int, are always the same size in the number of bits which helps achieve cross-platform compatibility.
Java used to be thought of as being slower than C, but that's become less important in recent years because computers are faster.
Java has exception-handling that requires a programmer to handle error-conditions such as Input/Output errors.
Code compiled on one Java platform can be run on other platforms that support Java without modification of either the source-code nor the byte-code.
Generics were added to Java in such a way so that existing code would still keep running.
Java has no unsigned integer types, which languages like C heavily use.
The IEEE has defined a standard for floating-point arithmetic, IEE 754. Java only supports a part of the features of this standard.
